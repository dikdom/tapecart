# tapecart DIY mod for 8MB flash access

This is a modification of the DIY variant of the tapecart to
have more than 2MB space available on flash to C64 when a
bigger Q25Wxx chip is used.
ccording to plans the firmware will check the size of the EEPROM during
startup and report back the correct value. At first only hardcoded
8MB will be implmented for testing purposes, as tapecart-browser also
has to be modified.

For creating the build environment install a barebone linux (Ubuntu is 
my personal choice) and install the following extra packages:
make gcc perl avr-libc git cc65 php mc xa65 gawk haskell-stack

After that follow the original build descriptions found in the subdirectories'
README file!

# About #

The tapecart is a low-cost flash storage device for the Commodore 64's
tape port. This repository contains source code and documentation
related to it and will one day contain the schematics and layout files too.

# Structure of the repository #

This repository is organized as follows:

* doc

    This directory contains general documentation regarding the
    tapecart like the protocol it uses to communicate with the C64.

* src-c64

    This directory containts the source code for the C64-side
    software, currently the initial loader and the flashtool.

* src-firmware

    This directory contains the source code for the firmware running
    on the tapecart.

* hardware

    This directory contains schematics and layout for various hardware
    variants of the tapecart.

* mass-programmer

    This directory contains schematics, layout and software for a
    Raspberry Pi addon board that can be used for mass-programming
    tapecarts.

Schematics and layout for the tapecart itself will be released at a
later date.
